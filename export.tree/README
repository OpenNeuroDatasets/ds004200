# Temporal Scaling

Twenty participants learned three temporal intervals. There were two subtasks, randomly interleaved. In the Production task, participants produced either a short, medium, or long temporal interval. In the Perception task, participants judged a computer-produced interval as correct or incorrect (again, for a short, medium, or long temporal interval). In both tasks participants received visual feedback (a checkmark or x).
